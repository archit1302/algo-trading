3. Market session analysis:
   - Identify market opening/closing times
   - Separate pre-market, regular, and after-hours sessions
   - Handle different market holidays across exchanges

**Implementation Framework:**
```python

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pytz

class TimeSeriesProcessor:
    def __init__(self, timezone='America/New_York'):
        self.timezone = timezone
        self.market_calendar = self.create_market_calendar()
    
    def parse_datetime(self, date_string, format_hint=None):
        """Parse various datetime formats"""
        pass
    
    def create_market_calendar(self, start_date=None, end_date=None):
        """Create custom trading calendar"""

    """
    resampled = df.resample(frequency).agg({
        'Open': 'first',
        'High': 'max',
        'Low': 'min',
        'Close': 'last',
        'Volume': 'sum'
    })

    metrics = pd.DataFrame(index=returns.index)
    
    # Rolling returns and volatility
    metrics['rolling_return'] = returns.rolling(window).mean() * 252
    metrics['rolling_vol'] = returns.rolling(window).std() * np.sqrt(252)
    
    # Rolling Sharpe ratio
    metrics['rolling_sharpe'] = metrics['rolling_return'] / metrics['rolling_vol']
    
    # Rolling maximum drawdown
    def rolling_max_drawdown(x):
        cumulative = (1 + x).cumprod()
        running_max = cumulative.expanding().max()
        drawdown = (cumulative - running_max) / running_max
        return drawdown.min()
    
    metrics['rolling_max_dd'] = returns.rolling(window).apply(rolling_max_drawdown)
    
    return metrics
